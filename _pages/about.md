I'm an Data Science & Artificial Intelligence consultant at DataFab. I received my 'Grande Ecole' Master's degree in Engineering from ENSIAME Engineering School at Haut-de-France Polytechnic University, and my M.S. in Operations Research and Machine Learning from TSINGHUA University. Before joining DataFab, I had the opportunity to work at a number of industrial research labs including ALTRAN research Labs and I have also worked in consultancy for Synechron.

My research lies in machine learning and data mining and spans the theory and algorithms of large-scale graph mining, statistical machine learning, and their applications in social and information networks. I have authored numerous papers and tutorials in top-tier conferences and journals. My research was selected among the best papers of ICDM in 2015, BigMine in 2012, and covered by popular press such as the MIT Technology Review. I'm honored to be selected by UC Berkeley among the rising stars in computer science and engineering in 2014. In addition, I co-founded the open source network repository project, the first data repository with interactive visual graph analytics to help researchers find, explore, and understand graph data in real-time over the web.
